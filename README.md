# java-txtfile-encoder
A Java program that gets an encryption key and a .txt file containing a message from a user and creates a new .txt file "encoded.txt" with the encrypted message.

Replace the fileName string in line 86 to the name and file location of your own .txt file to encode it.

"message.txt" in this repository is an example message, and "encoded.txt" in this repository is an example of "message.txt" after it is encoded using the program.
